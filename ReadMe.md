# SvGlide Web Component

This component allows you to make a quick Ux element composed of two svg triangles that you can customize a bit.  Hover over the element and they "glide" away revealing your custom background image or gif that may also be used as a link!  Need a bit of text to describe your element, certainly!

### Customizable attributes include:
  - `sv-glide` element Height and Width
  - Triangle left color, Triangle right color
  - Background image URL
  - `<a>` tag `href` attribute
  - A block of text

### To use the web component:
Grab the file for [svg-glide] and use the html import in the head of your document to link to the file like so:
```
<head>
<link rel="import" href="svGlide.html">
</head>
```

Currently there is only one way to configure the component:
```html
<sv-glide
    data-background = "url(//ImALinkJustLikeYouUseInCSS)"
    data-link = "placeThePathAsYouWouldInsideOfAnAnchorTagHref"
    data-svgWidth = "Numberpx"
    data-svgHeight = "Numberpx"
    data-leftFill = "color"
    data-rightFill = "color"> //end of opening tag
    
        <span class = "words">Your Text Here.</span>
    </sv-glide> //closing tag
```
### Notes

Things to keep in mind:

* The `data-svgWidth` and `data-svgHeight` must be in px format.
* `data-leftFill` and `data-rightFill` can be in any acceptable CSS format. (ie: hexcode, rgb, rgba, color name.
* You do not have to use a span tag, any tag for text will work but you do need to assign the tag the class "words".
* You do not need to include text or a link.





**Enjoy!**
